# Quarkus - OpenCV

## Introduction

With this Quarkus extension, you can use [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) in native executables generated by GraalVM.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.opencv</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-opencv</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST</version>
</dependency>
```

The OpenCV library is loaded automatically when starting your application so you don't need to load it yourself.
